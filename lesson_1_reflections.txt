How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Having this access to the entire history of any file would greatly help you search for errors without having to scavenge through the entire file itself.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Some of the pros of manually choosing when to create a commit are when you have a commit that you didn't made a typo or error on, rather than automatically saving that error, you have the chance whether to commit the edit or not. A pro of auto save is that you don't always have to save your work, and if you forget, it will be automatically saved.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
